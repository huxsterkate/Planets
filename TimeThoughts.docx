According to the second law of thermodynamic, time is unidirectional.

As long as entropy is increasing, time is moving forward. 

Entropy would have to be decreasing for time to move backwards.

This has not been observed.

We may see entropy decreasing in certain systems, but the external environment and total effect, in actuality, is that entropy is still increasing, such as in biological systems.
